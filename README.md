# MakeblockChristmasRobot
This program controls the Makeblock Ultimate 2.0 Robotic Arm Tank to navigate a terrain and do a specific action (go and pick up a Christmas ornament, go to the tree and put it on tree, go back to initial spot). Once the robot was built, the program was tested on Scratch and subsequently translated into Arduino. In the ChristmasRobot movie file, you can see the robot in action, executing the program below.
